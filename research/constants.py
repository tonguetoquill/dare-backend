"""
Constants for the Research app (Research Mode / the "epistemic ecosystem").

Naming follows the house style: choice groups are plain classes exposing a
``choices()`` classmethod (see ``mcp/constants.py``).

Only ``ResearchProjectStatus`` is enforced at the DB level — it is a workflow
state DARE itself sets. ``StandardsTemplate`` is kept here as a canonical
reference set for the UI/docs. Enabled tools are NOT modelled here: they are
stored as free-form slugs in ``ResearchProject.enabled_tools`` (the user's
connected MCP integrations, plus built-ins like web search), so there is no
hardcoded tool enum to keep in sync.
