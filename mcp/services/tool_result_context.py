      is told to finish the task — including correcting failed tool calls and
      calling the tool again — before answering in text. Without this, a model
      that receives a validation error tends to print the corrected document
      into chat instead of re-invoking the tool.
    - Final round (``final=True``): tools are stripped; the model must answer
      from the results it has.
