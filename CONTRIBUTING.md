# Contributing to DARE Backend

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This guide covers issues, pull requests, and the coding standards we follow.

## Filing issues

Before opening an issue:

1. Search the repository's existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Verify the bug reproduces against the latest `dev`.
3. Gather: environment (OS, Python version), reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behaviour, relevant logs.

### Bug reports

Include:

- **Environment** — OS, Python version, deployment path (Docker / bare-metal), browser if frontend-related.
- **Steps to reproduce** — minimal, numbered.
- **Expected behaviour**.
- **Actual behaviour** — including stack traces or error responses (redact secrets).
- **Severity** — does this block use, or is it a minor annoyance?

### Feature requests

Include:

- The user-facing problem you're trying to solve (not the implementation you have in mind).
- Who is affected.
- Any constraints or non-goals.

### Security issues

**Do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the disclosure process.

## Pull requests

### Before opening a PR

1. Fork the repository, sync the latest `dev`, and create a feature branch from `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull --ff-only origin dev
   git checkout -b your-name/feature/short-description
   ```

   Naming: `<author>/<feature|fix|refactor|docs>/<short-description>`.

2. Run the full local check suite:

   ```bash
   black --check .
   isort -c .
   python manage.py test
   ```

3. If your change touches the database, generate migrations and commit them:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

4. If your change touches the API, regenerate the OpenAPI schema if applicable.

### PR template

Each PR should include:

- **What** — one-paragraph summary.
- **Why** — motivation; link to the issue if there is one (`Closes #123`).
- **How** — high-level approach. Call out non-obvious decisions.
- **Testing** — how you verified the change. New tests added? Manual repro steps?
- **Screenshots / recordings** — for any user-facing or API-shape change.
- **Migration notes** — if backwards-incompatible.

### Review and merge

- At least one approving review from a maintainer.
- All CI checks green (lint, tests).
- Squash-merge by default. The squashed commit message becomes part of release notes — make it descriptive.
- Maintainers may rebase on `dev` before merging.

## Coding standards

### Python style

- **Formatter:** [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io) (line length 88). Run `black .` before committing.
- **Import order:** [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). Run `isort .`.
- **Type hints** are encouraged on new code, especially in `core/services/` and any module exposing a public surface.
- **Docstrings** on services and complex methods. One-line for trivial functions; numpydoc / Google style for anything heavier.

### Django conventions

- Models inherit from `BaseModel` (provides `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_active`, `is_deleted`).
- Use `Model.active_objects` for default-filtered querysets; `Model.objects` for unfiltered.
- Constants belong in per-app `constants.py` files using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices`.
- Wrap user-facing strings with `gettext_lazy as _`. **Do not** translate logged exceptions or developer-facing error messages.
- Keep views thin; push business logic into `core/services/` or model methods.

### REST API

- Inherit from `viewsets.ModelViewSet` for standard CRUD.
- Always declare `permission_classes`. Default to `[IsAuthenticated]`.
- Filter querysets by user in `get_queryset()` for any user-owned resource.
- Use serializer field separation for read vs. write (see [docs/code-standards.md](docs/code-standards.md) and [docs/serialization.md](docs/serialization.md)).

### Background jobs

- Anything blocking, slow, or external goes through Django RQ.
- Decorate with `@job('default')`.
- Idempotent where possible — workers may retry on failure.
- Log liberally; failures are inspected via `rqstats` and the worker log.

### Tests

- Use Django's `TestCase` for DB-dependent tests, `SimpleTestCase` otherwise.
- Mock external services (LLM APIs, vector stores, email) — never hit them in tests.
- Cover permission boundaries: a user should not be able to read another user's data.
- Async consumer tests use `ChannelsLiveServerTestCase` or `pytest-asyncio`.

### Commit messages

Conventional-ish: `<type>: <summary>` where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Keep the summary under 70 chars; use the body for context and rationale.

Example:

```
feat: add streaming TTS support to /chat namespace

Wires ElevenLabs into AIService.stream_chat_completion via an
optional `tts=True` flag. Audio chunks are emitted as base64
on a new `audio_chunk` Socket.IO event.

Closes #482.
```

### Code review etiquette

- Review for correctness, then design, then style. Style nits are last priority.
- Suggest, don't demand — `nit:`, `consider:`, and `blocking:` prefixes help calibrate.
- Approve when you'd be comfortable shipping the change as-is.

## Getting help

- Stuck? Open a draft PR and ask in the description — easier than hashing things out in chat.
- For larger architectural changes, file an issue with a design sketch _before_ writing code.
